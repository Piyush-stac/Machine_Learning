📘 Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my Machine Learning learning repository!
This is where I document my progress, implement algorithms from scratch, and explore projects step by step.
The purpose is not just to code but to understand the math, intuition, and real-world application behind ML models.

✅ Progress So Far

🔹 Linear Regression (One Variable)
Built the hypothesis function from scratch
Implemented Gradient Descent for parameter optimization
Trained on a small dataset & visualized results

🚀 Upcoming Topics

1. Multiple Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Trees & Random Forests
4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
6. Neural Networks (Introduction to Deep Learning)
7. Model Evaluation & Performance Metrics
8. Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing
 MANY MORE..

🛠 Tools & Libraries

Python 🐍
NumPy, Pandas – numerical & data handling
Matplotlib – visualization

(More to be added as I progress 🚀)
